**Bulky** is a simple and efficient tool for renaming multiple files and directories at once. Designed as an XApp, Bulky is compatible with a wide range of Linux distributions and desktop environments, including Cinnamon, MATE, and GNOME.

> **Note:** Thunar (the default file manager in Xfce) already includes a built-in file renamer, so Bulky may be redundant in Xfce environments.

## Features

- Batch rename files and folders with ease
- Cross-desktop compatibility (Cinnamon, MATE, GNOME, and more)
- Simple and user-friendly interface
